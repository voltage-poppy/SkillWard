- [Vulnerability management](#vulnerability-management)
- [Suggesting changes](#suggesting-changes)

## Disclosing a security issue

The `skill-scanner` maintainers take all security issues in the project seriously. Thank you for improving the security of `skill-scanner`. We appreciate your dedication to responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

`skill-scanner` leverages GitHub's private vulnerability reporting.

To learn more about this feature and how to submit a vulnerability report,
review [GitHub's documentation on private reporting](https://docs.github.com/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).

Here are some helpful details to include in your report:

- a detailed description of the issue
- the steps required to reproduce the issue
- versions of the project that may be affected by the issue
- if known, any mitigations for the issue

A maintainer will acknowledge the report and follow up with next steps.

If you've been unable to successfully draft a vulnerability report via GitHub
or have not received a timely response, please reach out via the
[FangcunGuard security contact email](mailto:security@fangcunguard.com).

After the initial reply to your report, the maintainers will endeavor to keep
you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask
for additional information or guidance.

## Vulnerability management

When the maintainers receive a disclosure report, they will assign it to a
primary handler.

This person will coordinate the fix and release process, which involves the
following steps:

- confirming the issue
- determining affected versions of the project
- auditing code to find any potential similar problems
- preparing fixes for all releases under maintenance

## Suggesting changes

If you have suggestions on how this process could be improved please submit an
issue or pull request.
